#+TITLE: Jed Clinger's Emacs configuration

My init.el was initially based on the structure of [[https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d][Magnar Sveen's
.emacs]]. I have since refactored it to a use-package based config.
my config resides in this file.

I do not recommend cloning this repo directly. Instead, copy and paste
use-package declarations or other code snippets into your own init.el
as needed.

* Installation

  You will need [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]] installed. It can be installed via homebrew or your
  OS's package manager.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
  git clone git@github.com:noonian/dot-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
  pushd ~/.emacs.d
  cask install
  #+END_SRC

  Now start Emacs and you should have my config. You will also need to
  install the "Inconsolata" font. You can work around this by changing
  the font in init.el to something standard on your machine.
